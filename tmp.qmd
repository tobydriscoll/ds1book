## Overfitting in kNN

Consider a kNN classifier with $k=1$. The class assigned to each value is just that of the nearest training example, making for a piecewise constant labelling. Let's see how this plays out in about as simple a classification problem as we can come up with: a single feature, with the class being the sign of the feature's value. (We arbitrarily assign zero to have class $+1$.)
